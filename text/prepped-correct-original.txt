once
upon
a
time
while
brahmadatta
was
king
of
benares
the
bodhisatta
came
to
life
at
the
foot
of
the
himalayas
as
a
monkey
he
grew
strong
and
sturdy
big
of
frame
well
to
do
and
lived
by
a
curve
of
the
river
ganges
in
a
forest
haunt
now
at
that
time
there
was
a
crocodile
dwelling
in
the
ganges
the
crocodiles
mate
saw
the
great
frame
of
the
monkey
and
she
conceived
a
longing
to
eat
his
heart
so
she
said
to
her
lord
sir
i
desire
to
eat
the
heart
of
that
great
king
of
the
monkeys
good
wife
said
the
crocodile
i
live
in
the
water
and
he
lives
on
dry
land
how
can
we
catch
him
by
hook
or
by
crook
she
replied
he
must
be
caught
if
i
dont
get
him
i
shall
die
all
right
answered
the
crocodile
consoling
her
dont
trouble
yourself
i
have
a
plan
i
will
give
you
his
heart
to
eat
so
when
the
bodhisatta
was
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
ganges
after
taking
a
drink
of
water
the
crocodile
drew
near
and
said
sir
monkey
why
do
you
live
on
bad
fruits
in
this
old
familiar
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
ganges
there
is
no
end
to
the
mango
trees
and
labuja
trees
with
fruit
sweet
as
honey
is
it
not
better
to
cross
over
and
have
all
kinds
of
wild
fruit
to
eat
lord
crocodile
the
monkey
answered
the
ganges
is
deep
and
wide
how
shall
i
get
across
if
you
want
to
go
i
will
let
you
sit
upon
my
back
and
carry
you
over
the
monkey
trusted
him
and
agreed
come
here
then
said
the
crocodile
up
on
my
back
with
you
and
up
the
monkey
climbed
but
when
the
crocodile
had
swum
a
little
way
he
plunged
the
monkey
under
the
water
good
friend
you
are
letting
me
sink
cried
the
monkey
what
is
that
for
the
crocodile
said
you
think
i
am
carrying
you
out
of
pure
good
nature
not
a
bit
of
it
my
wife
has
a
longing
for
your
heart
and
i
want
to
give
it
to
her
to
eat
friend
said
the
monkey
it
is
nice
of
you
to
tell
me
why
if
our
heart
were
inside
us
when
we
go
jumping
among
the
tree
tops
it
would
be
all
knocked
to
pieces
well
where
do
you
keep
it
asked
the
crocodile
the
bodhisatta
pointed
out
a
fig
tree
with
clusters
of
ripe
fruit
standing
not
far
off
see
said
he
there
are
our
hearts
hanging
on
yonder
fig
tree
if
you
will
show
me
your
heart
said
the
crocodile
then
i
wont
kill
you
take
me
to
the
tree
then
and
i
will
point
it
out
to
you
the
crocodile
brought
him
to
the
place
the
monkey
leapt
off
his
back
and
climbing
up
the
fig
tree
sat
upon
it
oh
silly
crocodile
said
he
you
thought
that
there
were
creatures
that
kept
their
hearts
in
a
treetop
you
are
a
fool
and
i
have
outwitted
you
you
may
keep
your
fruit
to
yourself
your
body
is
great
but
you
have
no
sense
and
then
to
explain
this
idea
he
uttered
the
following
stanzas
roseapple
jackfruit
mangoes
too
across
the
water
there
i
see
enough
of
them
i
want
them
not
my
fig
is
good
enough
for
me
great
is
your
body
verily
but
how
much
smaller
is
your
wit
now
go
your
ways
sir
crocodile
for
i
have
had
the
best
of
it
the
crocodile
feeling
as
sad
and
miserable
as
if
he
had
lost
a
thousand
pieces
of
money
went
back
sorrowing
to
the
place
where
he
lived
